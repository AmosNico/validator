                  planning tasks are routinely verified by independent
                  validation tools. For unsolvable planning tasks, no such
                  validation capabilities currently exist. We describe a
                  family of certificates of unsolvability for classical
                  planning tasks that can be efficiently verified and are
                  sufficiently general for a wide range of planning
                  approaches including heuristic search with delete
                  relaxation, critical-path, pattern database and linear
                  merge-and-shrink heuristics, symbolic search with binary
                  decision diagrams, and the Trapper algorithm for detecting
                  dead ends. We also augmented a classical planning system
                  with the ability to emit certificates of unsolvability and
                  implemented a planner-independent certificate validation
                  tool. Experiments show that the overhead for producing such
                  certificates is tolerable and that their validation is
                  practically feasible.},

  abstractnote  = {While traditionally classical planning concentrated on
                  finding plans for solvable tasks, detecting unsolvable
                  instances has recently attracted increasing interest. To
                  preclude wrong results, it is desirable that the planning
                  system provides a certificate of unsolvability that can be
                  independently verified. We propose a rule-based proof
                  system for unsolvability where a proof establishes a
                  knowledge base of verifiable basic statements and applies a
                  set of derivation rules to infer the unsolvability of the
                  task from these statements. We argue that this approach is
                  more flexible than a recent proposal of inductive
                  certificates of unsolvability and show how our proof system
                  can be used for a wide range of planning techniques.},
